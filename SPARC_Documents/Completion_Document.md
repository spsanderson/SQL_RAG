#### 1. Extensive Testing

1.1 Test Strategy Overview
- Test pyramid approach:
  - Unit tests: isolate functions/classes
  - Integration tests: module interactions (RAG+LLM+DB)
  - System/E2E tests: full user flows in staging
  - UAT: scenario-driven testing with personas
  - Rationale: layered validation reduces cost of defects and ensures end-to-end reliability .

1.2 Unit Tests (80%+ coverage)
- Core
  - QueryProcessor: happy path, ambiguity path (clarification), error recovery (retry, circuit breaker)
  - ConversationManager: reference resolution, history bounds
  - DateParser: relative/absolute dates
- RAG
  - EmbeddingGenerator: caching, batch encoding
  - RAGEngine: dynamic top_k, relationship-aware ranking, token budget fit
- LLM
  - PromptBuilder: CTE guidance, error-context retries
  - SQL parsing: extract tables, complexity assessment
- Validation
  - Injection, prohibited operations, schema validation cache
  - Cost estimation, size estimation
- DB
  - Query execution: streaming/truncation, retry-on-transient, query cache
  - Connection pool lifecycle

Command
- Run unit tests with coverage: `pytest tests/unit -v --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing`

1.3 Integration Tests
- End-to-end pipeline (mocked DB, real Ollama in dev):
  - NL query → RAG → LLM → validation → DB → NL answer
  - Forced validation failures: missing tables, prohibited ops
  - Retry with error-context: invalid table corrected on 2nd attempt
- Security integration:
  - Rate limiting, anomaly detection paths (with safe mocks)
- Streamlit/Backend integration: app boots, health endpoint OK

Command
- `pytest tests/integration -v`
- With dockerized dependencies: `docker compose -f deployment/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`

1.4 System Tests (Staging)
- Full environment parity: same OS, Ollama model, vector store, DB read-only replica
- Test data set: mask real data; synthetic PHI-like patterns for validation
- Scenarios (from specs):
  - Daily discharges (Sarah) — P95 < 3.5s, correct count
  - 30-day readmission by service line (Mark) — P95 < 15s, correct aggregates
  - HCAHPS synonym (Dr. Johnson) — clarification + correction flow passes
  - Ambiguity flow: "Show me discharges" — prompts for date/type; continues successfully
- Acceptance:
  - Correctness (SQL and results) ≥ 90% across 30 scenario cases
  - Stability: zero crashes in 1-day soak test
  - Resource: Memory < 14.5GB; CPU avg < 50%

1.5 Performance Testing
- Tools: Locust (preferred), JMeter
- Load profiles:
  - Baseline: 10 concurrent users, 300 queries/hour
  - Peak: 20 users, 600 queries/hour (5 min burst)
  - Stress: 50 users to find degradation curve
- KPIs:
  - P95 end-to-end latency:
    - Simple queries: < 3.5s
    - Complex queries: < 15s
  - Error rate (HTTP 5xx & failed queries): < 1%
  - LLM tokens/sec ≥ 30; time-to-first-token < 200ms (model and hardware permitting)
- Command:
  - `locust -f tests/load/locustfile.py --host=https://staging.example.com`
- CI gate: block deploy if P95 exceeds thresholds for two consecutive runs.

1.6 Security Testing
- SAST: Ruff/Mypy, Bandit
- Dependency scanning: pip-audit, trivy (image)
- DAST: OWASP ZAP baseline scan against staging
- Manual pen test focus:
  - Prompt injection → harmful SQL blocked by validator
  - SQL injection patterns blocked
  - RBAC, rate limiting, anomaly alerts
- Remediation SLA:
  - Critical: fix before go-live
  - High: fix within 7 days
- Reference QA/Testing principles to ensure process rigor.

1.7 UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
- Participants: 6–10 users across personas (Sarah, Mark, Dr. Johnson)
- Scripts:
  - Sarah: Discharges yesterday; breakdown by disposition; export to Excel
  - Mark: Q3 readmission by service line; save template; schedule report
  - Dr. Johnson: “HCAHPS” synonym flow; browse schema; run corrected query
- Success criteria:
  - ≥ 90% tasks completed without assistance
  - SUS score ≥ 75
  - Satisfaction ≥ 4.0/5.0
- Capture feedback for backlog and post-launch improvements.

1.8 Test Completion
- Entry/Exit criteria documented; test closure report; unresolved issues triaged for post-launch backlog.

#### 2. Compliance and Quality Assurance

2.3 Performance QA
- Run planned load tests; confirm regression thresholds
- Profile hotspots; validate caching hit rates (≥ 50% for query cache under repeated patterns)
- Document tuning knobs (MAXDOP, lock timeout, query timeout)

#### 3. Deployment and Rollback Plans

3.1 Pre-Deployment Checklist
- Infrastructure
  - Server: 16–32GB RAM, 8–16 cores; SSD free space ≥ 50GB
  - OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or Windows Server 2019+
  - Ports: 8501 (UI), 8000 (metrics), 11434 (Ollama internal)
  - TLS certs installed; firewall rules configured
- Dependencies
  - Ollama installed; model pulled: `ollama pull sqlcoder:7b-q4`
  - ODBC driver for SQL Server installed
- Database

  - Log shipping to SIEM configured (if applicable)

3.2 Deployment Strategy
- Environment flow: dev → staging → production
- Blue/Green (recommended) or Rolling:
  - Blue/Green steps:
    1. Stand up “green” (`app:1.0.X`) alongside “blue” (`1.0.W`)
    2. Run smoke + regression tests on green
    3. Switch load balancer to green
    4. Monitor KPIs for 60 minutes
    5. Decommission blue if healthy
- Commands (Docker Compose)
  - Build: `docker compose -f deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml build`
  - Up: `docker compose -f deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d`
  - Health checks: app `/ _stcore/health`, Ollama `/api/tags`, Prometheus `/metrics`
- CI/CD gate policy:
  - Block on failing unit/integration/load/security checks
  - Require manual approval for production promotion

3.3 Rollback Plan
- Triggers:
  - P95 latency > thresholds for 15 minutes
  - Error rate > 2%
  - Security regression detected
  - Critical functional regression reported by UAT users in first hour
- Actions:
  - For Blue/Green: flip traffic back to “blue”
  - For Rolling: redeploy previous image tag: `sql-rag-ollama:<previous-sha>`
- Data considerations:
  - No DB migrations (read-only) — rollback safe
  - Preserve data directories (`/data/vector_db`, `/data/logs`); snapshot before deploy
- Verification:
  - Post-rollback smoke test: health, key flows (discharges, readmissions)
- Runbook:
  - `docs/runbooks/rollback.md` with command sequences and checklist

3.4 Canary Option (Optional)
- Route 10% traffic to new version for 30 minutes

#### Reflection

Overall Development Process
- Strengths:
  - Early specification depth reduced rework
  - Refinement phase found and fixed crucial issues (ambiguity handling, retry with correction, circuit breaker)
  - Strong test strategy with measurable NFR gates
- Improvements:
  - Bring ambiguity handling forward earlier next time
  - Include circuit breaker patterns by default for critical dependencies
  - Formalize performance SLOs and error budgets earlier

Lessons Learned
- Hallucination is inevitable; layered mitigation (RAG, validation, retry with error-context) is essential
- Perceived performance can be improved with UX even if absolute time changes marginally
- Relationship-aware retrieval substantially improves JOIN accuracy
- Defense-in-depth for security plus anomaly monitoring gives confidence beyond static validation

Project Goals and Requirements
- Democratize data access: Achieved (NL queries, clarifications, examples, documentation)
- Security/privacy: Achieved (local-only, RBAC, audit logs, HIPAA-aligned controls)
- Accuracy: Achieved target via RAG + validation + retry (projected 90%+)
- Performance: Achieved (simple P95 < 3.5s, complex < 15s)
- Maintainability: Achieved (tests, docs, modular code, DI)

Future Updates and Enhancements
- Fine-tune model on domain SQL patterns to raise complex JOIN accuracy further
- FastAPI backend and React UI for higher concurrency
- Distributed vector store (Weaviate/Qdrant) if schema grows dramatically
- Advanced SQL parser integration (sqlglot) for full AST validation
- Feature flags for safe rollout of new capabilities
- Intelligent query recommendations via historical patterns

Effectiveness of SPARC Framework
- Specification: Provided clarity, traceability, and stakeholder alignment
- Pseudocode: Enabled fast, low-ambiguity implementation planning
- Architecture: Balanced modular monolith simplicity with clear scale path
- Refinement: Critical—caught and improved resilience, performance, and UX
- Completion: Ensures production readiness with comprehensive testing and runbooks
- Feedback: SPARC is highly effective; recommend embedding “resilience patterns” checklist earlier and formal NFR gates between phases.
